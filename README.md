## 🥦 Introduction

This is my dedicated personal webapp, designed to showcase my professional portfolio. The core requirement is a simple presentation of information, while still conveying my passion for UI design. The application is built with Vite, React and TypeScript.

## 🫑 Features

The app presents:
- Biography
- Links to some of my other stuff
- SE Projects
- Work History
- Education History 
- Skill set

## 🥨 Getting Started

This project is designed to run within a DevContainer, hence running it with VS Code + the devcontainers extenstion is advised.

1. Clone the repo 
2. Optional: reopen the project in the container (this will build and run it the first time)
3. Install deps ( I use yarn, you could also use npm if you want. )
4. Run dev script (yarn dev/npm run dev) 

### 🍌 Prerequisites
 
- Docker
- VSCode + devcontainers extenstion OR manually install the packaged deps (Node, yarn/npm, etc). 
- Web Browser
- A brain

## 🍍 Contributing 

I mean, if you really want to open a PR, you can. I might even approve it!
